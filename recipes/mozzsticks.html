    <h2>Air Fryer Mozzarella Sticks</h2>
    <p>These homemade mozzarella sticks offer all of the crispy-coated, cheesy goodness you want without the deep-fried mess on your stovetop. We like to call that a “win-win.”         
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (about 4 1/4 oz.) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup seasoned panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)</li>
        <li>8 (1-oz.) mozzarella string cheese sticks</li>
        <li>½ cup marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            Combine flour and baking soda in a shallow dish. Whisk eggs and milk together in a second shallow dish. Pour panko in a third shallow dish. Coat cheese sticks in flour mixture, and then in egg mixture; coat in breadcrumbs. Freeze breaded cheese sticks for 30 minutes.

            Lightly coat air-fryer basket with cooking spray. Add 4 sticks at a time to fryer basket, and cook at 400°F for 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining cheese sticks, and serve immediately with marinara sauce.
