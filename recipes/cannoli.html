    <h2>Air Fryer Cannolis</h2>
    <p>
        The air fryer’s strengths span far beyond crisping up frozen French fries. Here, the countertop appliance provides a perfect shortcut to homemade cannoli (a traditionally labor intensive treat to make). In this impressive air fryer dessert, prepared pie dough is used to create the crunchy, buttery richness you’d expect from a deep-fried cannoli shell. Though all of the ingredients for this air-fryer cannoli are easily found at any supermarket, you may need to order the cannoli tubes if you do not already have a set. (However, you can also use aluminum foil formed into a cylindrical shape in lieu of the tubes.) <em>Pro-tip: Don’t skip draining your ricotta cheese! This essential step keeps the filling from being too moist—leading to soggy cannoli shells.</em>
