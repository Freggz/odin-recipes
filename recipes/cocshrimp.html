    <h2>Air Fryer Coconut Shrimp</h2>
    <p>
        You can count on your air fryer to turn a normal Friday into a #friyay, especially if this beach-dive-inspired recipe is on the menu. Coconut and panko team up to create an amazingly crispy coating for this shrimp; use finely shredded coconut to guarantee better crust adhesion. If you can’t track down finely shredded coconut, pulse the coconut in your food processor or give it a quick chop until it’s more finely ground. Fresh from your air fryer and dunked in this sweet-and-tangy honey-lime sauce, this addictive app will make you feel like you’re on a Caribbean beach.

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup (about 2 1/8 oz.) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>⅓ cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)</li>
        <li>12 ounces medium peeled, deveined raw shrimp, tail-on (about 24 shrimp)</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            Stir together flour and pepper in a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a second shallow dish. Stir together coconut and panko in a third shallow dish. Holding each shrimp by the tail, dredge shrimp in flour mixture, making sure not to coat tail; shake off excess. Dip in egg, allowing any excess to drip off. Dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.

            Place half of the shrimp in air fryer basket, and cook at 400°F until golden, 6 to 8 minutes, turning shrimp over halfway through cooking. Season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Repeat with remaining shrimp and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            While shrimp cook, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile in small bowl. Sprinkle shrimp with cilantro, if desired. Serve with sauce.
